# Homework-Challenge-04-Iliyaas-Timed-Coding-Quiz

## Description
This is JavaScript based timed coding quiz application that is designed to challenge the user's knowledge through a series of timed questions. This interactive quiz offers a dynamic experience by presenting coding related questions and multiple choice answers. Users are given 15 seconds to answer each question for a total of 75 seconds. This adds an element of urgency and excitment to the quiz. When a wrong answer is submitted -10 is deducted from the time remaining. The user's high score is determined by the amount of time remaining after the last question is answered. The user then has the ability to enter their initials which along with their score are saved in the browsers local memory.
